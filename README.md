## 📁 Configuration

Create a new folder/repo with a `config.yaml` file inside where you will list your repositories and domains to scan.

### Example:

```yaml
project:
  name: My project
domains:
  - my-domain.com
  - subdomain.my-domain.com
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
    description: "Short description of the project"
    branch: "main"

  - url: https://github.com/your-org/another-repo
    description: "Another awesome project"
```

#### 🔐 Accessing Private Repositories

Secrover supports cloning **private repositories via HTTPS** using a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

> We currently support **HTTPS only** (SSH is not yet supported).

##### 1. 🧾 Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

* Go to [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Click **"Generate new token"** (fine-grained)
* Give it a name like `Secrover`
* Choose "Only select repositories" and select the private repos Secrover needs to clone
  * Under **Repository permissions**, grant:
    * **Contents: Read-only**
* Generate and **copy** the token

##### 2. 📄 Create a `.env` file

In the same directory as your `config.yaml`, create a `.env` file:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=yourgeneratedtokenhere
```

> **⚠️ Do not share this file or commit it to version control.**
> Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental leaks.

## 🐳 Install & run with Docker

You can run Secrover easily using Docker without installing any local dependencies.

From your external project directory (the one containing `config.yaml`), run:

### ▶️ With private repositories (.env required)

If you're scanning private GitHub repositories, create a `.env` file containing your GitHub token (see [🔐 Accessing Private Repositories](#-accessing-private-repositories)).

Then run:

```bash
docker pull secrover/secrover && docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" \
  -e CONFIG_FILE=config.yaml \
  secrover/secrover
```

### ▶️ Without private repositories (.env not needed)

If you're only scanning public repos, you can skip the `.env` file:

```bash
docker pull secrover/secrover && docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" \
  -e CONFIG_FILE=config.yaml \
  secrover/secrover
```

This will:

* Read the list of repositories and domains from your `config.yaml`
* Clone repositories, scan them, as well as your domains
* Generate a full **HTML security report** into the `output/` folder
