## Demo

You can see Secrover in action right now:

- üìÇ Example GitHub repository: [secrover-demo](https://github.com/secrover/secrover-demo)
- üìä Live generated report: [demo.secrover.org](https://demo.secrover.org)

### How the demo works

The demo repository uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically:

1. Pull the latest version of Secrover (via Docker).
2. Run security scans on Secrover repositories and domains.
3. Generate an **HTML security report**.
4. Deploy the report to **GitHub Pages**, making it publicly accessible.

> This setup is ideal for **publicly sharing reports**, for example on GitHub Pages or a public website.

‚û°Ô∏è You can copy the workflow from the [demo repository‚Äôs `.github/workflows/secrover.yml`](https://github.com/secrover/secrover-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/secrover.yml) to get started quickly.

### Flexible Deployment Options

Secrover is not limited to GitHub Actions ‚Äî you can [also export reports to any remote destination](#-exporting-reports-optional) (SFTP, WebDAV, SMB, S3, Google Drive, etc.) using rclone, making them automatically available on internal servers, intranet sites, cloud storage, or backup locations.

This flexibility ensures that whether you want **public reporting** or **private/internal hosting**, Secrover can fit your workflow.

## Getting Started

Secrover is designed to be simple: configure what you want to scan, then run it with Docker.  
Within minutes, you‚Äôll have a professional **HTML security report** you can share.

Create a new folder/repo with a `config.yaml` file inside where you will list your repositories and domains to scan.

### Example:

```yaml
project:
  name: My project
domains:
  - my-domain.com
  - subdomain.my-domain.com
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
    description: "Short description of the project"
    branch: "main"

  - url: https://github.com/your-org/another-repo
    description: "Another awesome project"
```

#### Accessing Private Repositories

Secrover supports cloning **private repositories via HTTPS** using a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

> We currently support **HTTPS only** (SSH is not yet supported).

##### 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

* Go to [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Click **"Generate new token"** (fine-grained)
* Give it a name like `Secrover`
* Choose "Only select repositories" and select the private repos Secrover needs to clone
  * Under **Repository permissions**, grant:
    * **Contents: Read-only**
* Generate and **copy** the token

##### 2. Create a `.env` file

In the same directory as your `config.yaml`, create a `.env` file:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=yourgeneratedtokenhere
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Do not share this file or commit it to version control.**
> Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental leaks.

## Install & run with Docker

You can run Secrover easily using Docker without installing any local dependencies.

### One-Time Scan (on-demand)

From the folder where your `config.yaml` (and optionally `.env`) lives, run:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" \
  secrover/secrover
```

> üí° If you‚Äôre only scanning public repositories or do not need to change default settings, the `--env-file .env` flag is optional.

**What happens:**

* Secrover read the list of repositories and domains from your `config.yaml`
* It clones repositories, scan them, as well as your domains
* It generates a full **HTML security report** into the `output/` folder

### Automated Scans (Cron Mode)

Secrover also supports **automatic recurring scans** using an internal cron scheduler (via [Supercronic](https://github.com/aptible/supercronic)).

You can schedule scans to run periodically **inside the container** ‚Äî ideal for servers, NAS setups, ...

### Example: Run every day at midnight

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" \
  -e CRON_SCHEDULE="0 0 * * *" \
  secrover/secrover
```

**What happens:**

* Secrover starts Supercronic in the background
* It executes a new scan based on the chosen schedule
* By default, results are written to `/output` and logs to `/output/secrover.log`

### üì§ Exporting Reports (Optional)

Secrover can upload generated reports to remote destinations (SFTP, WebDAV, SMB, S3, etc.) via [rclone](https://rclone.org/).

For setup instructions and advanced options, see [EXPORT.md](docs/export.md).

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable         | Required | Default              | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CONFIG_FILE`    | ‚úÖ        | `/config.yaml`       | Path to your YAML configuration inside the container.                                                        |
| `OUTPUT_DIR`     | ‚úÖ        | `/output`            | Directory where reports and logs are saved.                                                                  |
| `REPOS_DIR`      | ‚úÖ        | `repos`              | Directory where git repos are cloned.                                                                        |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`   | ‚ùå        | `-`                  | Used to clone private GitHub repositories over HTTPS.                                                        |
| `CRON_SCHEDULE`  | ‚ùå        | `-`                  | Optional [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/) to schedule recurring scans                                |
| `EXPORT_ENABLED` | ‚ùå        | `false`              | Enable exporting reports to remote destinations using rclone.                                                |
| `RCLONE_REMOTES` | ‚ùå        | `-`                  | Comma-separated list of rclone remote names (from `rclone.conf`) to upload reports to.                       |
| `RCLONE_PATH`    | ‚ùå        | `/secrover-reports/` | Path on the remote(s) where reports should be uploaded. Supports timestamp expansion using `$(date +FORMAT)` |

All variables can be defined in your `.env` file **or** passed directly using `-e` flags when running the container.
For example:

```bash
-e CONFIG_FILE=config.yaml -e OUTPUT_DIR=/output
```

is equivalent to having them set in your `.env` file.
